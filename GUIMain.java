/*
NOTES:
I originally intended to add a few more features to this program. However, I am unable to, due to time constraints.
I have fixed all of the bugs that I have found, but due to the size and complexity of this program (WHY DID I
OVER COMPLICATE EVERYTHING??!), there may be some bugs that I have not murdered yet :)
Also, some parts are not very well commented, because I don`t really know how to explain them using words.
